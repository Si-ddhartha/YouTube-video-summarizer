# YouTube Video Summarizer
This program is designed to streamline the process of summarizing YouTube videos by automatically generating a detailed, coherent summary of any video's transcript. It's especially useful for users who want to quickly grasp the key points of a video without having to sit through its entire duration. Whether it's a lengthy tutorial, an informational talk, or a lecture, this tool efficiently extracts the main ideas, saving time and effort.

## How It Works:
- **Transcript Extraction**: The program leverages the Pytubefix library to access the video’s captions (English or auto-generated) and extract the full transcript.
- **Summary Generation:** Using Google’s Generative AI, it processes the transcript with a carefully designed prompt. This ensures that the summary covers all important points such as the main topic, subtopics, key details, examples, data, and conclusions.

## Practical Use:
This program is perfect for individuals who don't have time to watch an entire video but still want to capture the key information. It is ideal for students, professionals, and anyone who regularly consumes online educational content, presentations, or news but prefers quick summaries.

## Example:
